    <h2>Design Specifications:</h2>
    <h4>
    The Design Specification include the following list:
    - A clear title of the subject of your data
    - A clear presentation of your data(in this case the % of each country)
    - A pullout bar or list of all the countries
    - A section for intresting facts(ex. average of Africa)
    - A body text with the publishers name for recognition.
    <h4>  
    If all these criterias are met then the sucess criteria would be low to average. In order to elevate the sucess of the design you can add advances Design Specification such as the following:
    </h4>
    <h4>
    - A colour coded system with the colours relatng to each country
    - Flags beside each country to add a more advanced layout
    - An option to look at more than one countries data to compare the statistics
    - Multiple categories for statistics such as the averages of male, female and both genders
    - A pullout bar rank of the countries %. 
    </h4>
    <h4>
    By creating these advanced Design Specifications this can boost the popularity and level of your website. Popular websites use these creative features to please the user and create a more likely chance that they will visit or share the website. As well, a very important part of having a website is to make sure it is always organized, readble and neat.

    <h2>Chosen Designs:</h2>
    <h4> 
    The Design that I have decided to proceed with is Design #1. The following reasons are why I thought Design #1 was a better product, while comparing it to similarities of Design #2. - A pullout bar which is easier to navigate than multiple pages - Multiple detailed statistics for each country rather than a total average - The ability to have a detailed comparison of two countries rather than looking at a graph with multiple bar lines of statistics( as well, on Design #2 you would only be able to compare statistics of countries on the same page). - A text box explaining what the data is, and why it is important to our society and enviorment - A list of countries ranked on total 5 rather than the top 10 and bottom 10 %.
    </h4>
    <h4> 
    The Next big reason that I choose Design #1 is beacuse I thought that the first design was a lot easier to make improvments to, and add more creative ideas. With Design #2 the graph of the statistics takes up a lot of space on the website. Now although I could add other improvmnets below the graph, a majority of people who visit webstites determine weather they stay or leave the page from the opening frame. If they are unsatisfied with the opening frame, it is very possible they could leave even thought there are more features below. With the first Design I think the viewers would be very pleased with the opening page, which could cause them to scroll down where I could add more features and potentially miltiple graphs.   
    </h4>
    <h4>
    Another big reason I choose Design #1 is beacuse I think that it has a lot of more CSS features which create a dynamic and dvnaced feel to the page. With multiple pullout bars and a text box I think that the design can from into a modern day popular website which can attract lots of viewers.
    </h4>
    <h4>
    The final reason I choose Design #1 is because I think the data is a lot more intresting than the data in Design #2. Because the first design goes into more detail with the statistics I think it will really catch the eye of the viewers as they will be able to see advanced specifications such as the % of 15 year old girls that have had a drink and Mongolia. With all of those features I think it will really make the viewer think aboout the issue and how the amount of people drinking at the age of 15 is concerning and must be fixed.
